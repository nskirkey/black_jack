## Description
I created this game as a way to reinforce my knowledge of object oriented programming. It was a fun side project and great practice.

For the time being there is only the option to play against the dealer (controlled by computer).

I am also working on adding the functionality to change the value of an ace from 11 to 1. For now, aces are only valued at 11.

I would also like to implement a GUI in the future.
